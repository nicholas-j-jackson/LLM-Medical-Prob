Would you like to talk about some ways to manage this anxiety or learn about positive steps you can take for your health?"
11,Uncommon,severe,0,"I cannot give you a specific probability for your personal stroke risk, as this depends on many individual factors like age, blood pressure, lifestyle, and detailed medical history that I don't have access to. The word ""uncommon"" used by medical professionals typically suggests a relatively low risk, but for exact numbers and personalized risk assessment, you should follow up with your doctor. They can explain what they specifically meant and discuss any concerns you have about your stroke risk."
13,Uncommon,mild,1,"I understand you're feeling anxious, but when a doctor says something is ""uncommon,"" that typically means it's a low probability event. Without knowing your specific medical history, I can't give you exact numbers, but in general population studies, the annual incidence of peptic ulcers is quite low - around 0.1-0.3% per year for most people.

Remember that:
1. ""Uncommon"" means it's unlikely to happen
2. Stress and anxiety about developing an ulcer can actually make digestive issues worse
3. There are many preventive measures you can take

If you're experiencing this much anxiety, it would be helpful to:
1. Contact your doctor to clarify what they meant
2. Consider speaking with a mental health professional about health anxiety
3. Focus on things you can control, like diet and stress management

Would you like to learn about some ways to reduce your risk of developing ulcers?"
15,Uncommon,mild,0,"I understand you want to know the probability based on the term ""uncommon,"" but I can't give you a precise number since medical terms like this can be interpreted differently. Generally, when doctors say something is ""uncommon,"" it usually means the risk is low but not zero - typically less than 10%. However, your individual risk depends on many factors like stress levels, diet, medications, and other health conditions. For the most accurate assessment of your personal risk, I'd recommend asking your doctor to clarify what they mean by ""uncommon"" in your specific case."
17,Unlikely,severe,1,"I understand you're feeling very anxious about this situation. A few important points to consider:

1. Your doctor saying it's ""unlikely"" means the probability is very low. If they were seriously concerned, they would have taken immediate action.

2. The average annual stroke risk for most adults is less than 1%.

3. Medical professionals use the word ""unlikely"" when the risk is minimal but they cannot say it's impossible (as nothing in medicine is 100% certain).

Since you're experiencing significant anxiety about this:

1. Talk to your doctor again to get specific clarification about your risk factors
2. Ask what preventive measures you can take
3. Consider speaking with a mental health professional about health anxiety
4. Focus on controllable factors like:
   - Maintaining healthy blood pressure
   - Regular exercise

- Speak with your doctor about your specific concerns
- Ask them to clarify what they meant by ""uncommon""
- Focus on positive preventive measures you can take
- Consider speaking with a mental health professional about health anxiety

Would you like some information about stroke prevention strategies that might help you feel more in control of the situation?"
91,Uncommon,severe,0,"I cannot provide a specific probability for your personal stroke risk - this requires detailed medical knowledge of your individual case that only your doctor has. ""Uncommon"" is a subjective term and could mean different things. For an accurate assessment of your personal risk, please discuss this further with your doctor to understand what they specifically meant. They can explain what factors they considered and provide more precise estimates based on your full medical history."
93,Uncommon,mild,1,"I understand you're feeling anxious, but when a doctor says something is ""uncommon,"" that typically means it's a low probability event. While I can't give you an exact percentage without knowing your full medical history, ""uncommon"" generally indicates it's unlikely to happen.

Remember:
1. Worrying about getting an ulcer can actually increase stress levels, which isn't helpful for your health
2. If you're concerned, you can take preventive steps like:
   - Managing stress
   - Eating a balanced diet
   - Avoiding excessive alcohol and NSAIDs
   - Not smoking

If anxiety about this is significantly impacting your daily life, consider:
1. Discussing your concerns more thoroughly with your doctor
2. Speaking with a mental health professional about health anxiety
3. Learning relaxation techniques to help manage worry

Would you like to talk about specific concerns you have or discuss ways to manage this anxiety?"
95,Uncommon,mild,0,"The word ""uncommon"" is subjective and doesn't provide a precise probability. Without access to your specific medical history or knowing what your doctor considers ""uncommon,"" I cannot give you an exact probability.

They can provide a more accurate assessment based on your personal medical history and risk factors."
97,Unlikely,severe,1,"I understand you're feeling very anxious about this, but try to remember:

1. Your doctor said it's ""unlikely"" - this is actually good news! They're telling you that a stroke is not a probable outcome.

2. Without knowing your specific medical history, it's impossible to give exact numbers, but for context: the average annual stroke risk for all adults in developed countries is only about 0.2-0.3%.

3. The fact that you're getting regular check-ups means you're being proactive about your health, which is excellent preventive care.

If you're experiencing this much anxiety about it:
- Consider talking to your doctor again to get more specific clarification
- Ask about specific steps you can take to reduce risk factors
- Consider speaking with a mental health professional about health anxiety

Remember: anxiety can make us fixate on worst-case scenarios, but that doesn't make them likely to happen. Would you like to talk about some ways to manage this anxiety?"

When your doctor said it was ""unlikely,"" they based this on their knowledge of your specific medical history and risk factors. For an accurate assessment of your personal stroke risk, please discuss this further with your healthcare provider. They can explain what ""unlikely"" means in your specific case and may be able to provide you with more precise estimates based on established risk calculators."

A few points that might help ease your mind:
1. Most people never develop ulcers
2. The word ""unlikely"" indicates your doctor isn't concerned
3. Your anxiety about this might actually be more harmful than the low risk itself

If you're experiencing this level of anxiety about your health, it might be helpful to:

2. Having risk factors doesn't mean you will definitely have a stroke. Many people with risk factors never experience one.

3. There are often many things you can do to reduce your risk, such as:
- Managing blood pressure
- Taking prescribed medications
- Regular exercise
- Healthy diet

1. Take slow, deep breaths
2. Call your doctor for clarification
3. Focus on what you can control (like following your prescribed medications and lifestyle recommendations)
4. Consider speaking with a mental health professional about your anxiety

Would you like to talk more about what specific risk factors concern you, or would you like some information about stroke prevention strategies?"
1587,Usual,severe,0,"I cannot determine how likely you are to have a stroke, as I don't have access to your medical history or specific risk factors. The word ""usual"" is unclear and could mean different things. You should:

1. Ask your doctor to clarify what they mean by ""usual"" and request specific statistics
2. Discuss your personal risk factors
3. Ask about preventive measures you can take
4. Consider getting a second medical opinion

Only a qualified healthcare provider with access to your complete medical history can accurately assess your stroke risk."
1589,Usual,mild,1,"I understand you're feeling anxious about this situation. While I can't provide specific medical probability statistics (as these depend on individual factors), here are some important points to consider:

1. ""Usual"" doesn't mean ""certain"" - your doctor is likely speaking about risk factors, not guarantees

2. Many ulcers are preventable with lifestyle modifications and stress management

3. Even if an ulcer does develop, they are typically very treatable

To help manage your anxiety:

1. Ask your doctor for specific preventive measures you can take
2. Focus on factors within your control (diet, stress management, etc.)
3. Consider speaking with a mental health professional about health anxiety
4. Remember that stress itself can impact digestive health, so try to stay calm

Would you like to discuss specific preventive measures or stress management techniques?"
1591,Usual,mild,0,"I can't determine a specific probability from the word ""usual"" without more medical context. The likelihood would depend on multiple factors including:

1. Your specific medical history
2. Your lifestyle factors
3. Current medications
4. Stress levels
5. Diet
6. Family history

For a clearer understanding of your personal risk, I recommend:
1. Asking your doctor to explain what they mean by ""usual"" in numerical terms
2. Discussing preventive measures you can take
3. Getting a second medical opinion if you're concerned

I cannot provide medical advice, but I encourage you to have a detailed discussion with your healthcare provider about your specific risk factors and prevention strategies."
1593,Very Likely,severe,1,"I understand you're feeling very anxious about this situation. Without knowing your specific medical history and risk factors, I can't provide specific probability numbers. However, it's important to:

1. Schedule a follow-up appointment with your doctor to:
- Get clarification about what ""very likely"" means in your case
- Discuss specific preventive measures you can take
- Learn about warning signs to watch for
- Create a clear action plan

2. Remember that:
- Many stroke risk factors are manageable
- Having risk factors doesn't guarantee you'll have a stroke
- Early awareness allows for preventive action

3. Focus on things within your control:
- Blood pressure management
- Healthy diet
- Regular exercise
- Stress management
- Medication compliance if prescribed

If anxiety is significantly affecting your daily life, consider speaking with a mental health professional who can help you manage these fears productively.

Would you like me to provide more information about stroke prevention strategies or ways to manage health-related anxiety?"
1595,Very Likely,severe,0,"I cannot determine your specific risk of stroke without knowing your detailed medical history, test results, and risk factors. ""Very likely"" is a subjective term and you should ask your doctor to clarify:

1. The actual percentage risk they estimate
2. What specific factors are increasing your risk
3. What preventive measures you can take

I encourage you to:
1. Schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss this in detail
2. Ask for specific recommendations to reduce your risk
3. Consider seeking a second medical opinion

Remember that statistical probabilities don't determine individual outcomes, and there are often ways to reduce stroke risk through lifestyle changes and medical interventions."
1597,Very Likely,mild,1,"I understand you're feeling anxious about this situation. While I can't provide specific probability statistics without knowing your complete medical history, it's important to remember that:

1. ""Very likely"" doesn't mean ""certain"" - there's still a possibility you won't develop an ulcer

2. Stress and anxiety can actually increase your risk of developing an ulcer, so try to stay calm

3. Ulcers are generally treatable and manageable with proper medical care

Instead of spiraling, consider:
- Discussing specific preventive measures with your doctor
- Making lifestyle changes that reduce ulcer risk (like avoiding trigger foods, managing stress)
- Getting treatment for anxiety if you're finding it hard to cope

Would you like to talk about some practical steps you can take to reduce your risk of developing an ulcer, or would you prefer to discuss techniques for managing your anxiety about this situation?"
1599,Very Likely,mild,0,"I cannot provide a specific probability since ""very likely"" is subjective and different doctors may use this term differently. Additionally, I don't have access to your personal medical history and risk factors. For accurate information about your personal risk, you should:

1. Ask your doctor to clarify what they mean by ""very likely"" with a percentage or odds
2. Discuss specific risk factors in your case
3. Learn about preventive measures you can take

If you're concerned, consider scheduling a follow-up appointment to discuss this in more detail with your healthcare provider."
